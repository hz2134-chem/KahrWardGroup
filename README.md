**Overview**

This Repository contains codes for research on twisted organic crystals and chiroptical modelling. MATLAB is used to model optical properties; Python is used to build crystals for molecular dynamic simulation and related analysis.

**Folders**

Band_Coherence_Optics: Scripts for simulating optical properties in banded spherulites. Incoherence in banding on all axes are taken into consideration. Can be customized according to crystal symmetry.

Fiber_Optics: Scripts for visualzing optical properties in overlapping fibers, which we propose as the major source of circular retardance in twisted crystals. Also provides analysis of potential order changes to assess the reliability of optical characterization.

Eshelby_Untwisting: Scripts for molecular dynamic simulation of crystalline benzil rods and related analysis.

**Instructions**

All scripts are self-contained. Detailed instructions are in the code.
